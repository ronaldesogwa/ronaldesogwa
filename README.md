Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm @ronaldesogwa, a full-stack developer from Lagos, Nigeria.

I'm currently studying at Caleb University, Lagos, where I'm building my skills in both front-end and back-end development. I love creating user-friendly applications and tackling new challenges in the tech world.

In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, which helps me stay creative and up-to-date with the latest trends. I also spend a lot of time programming, always looking to learn and improve.

I'm excited to join a great team where I can contribute to exciting projects and continue growing as a developer.
